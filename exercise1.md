## CI Steps and Tools
In this hypothetical situation our team uses python.

### Linting
For keeping our code clean and maintainable we use `pylint`, a widely used tool for this purpose. It checks the code against PEP 8 standards and other configurable rules. `pylint` can be integrated into Visual Studio Code, making it convenient for developers to catch issues early in the development process.

### Testing
For testing we use `pytest` which is a popular choice among Python developers due to its simplicity and flexibility. `pytest` supports various types of tests, including unit tests, functional tests, and integration tests. It also has a rich plugin architecture that allows for extended capabilities, such as coverage reporting and parallel test execution.

### Building
As our project uses python, there isn't an explicit build step. Instead, the focus is on packaging and dependency management, which in our project is handled by `pip`.

## CI Alternatives to Jenkins and GitHub Actions

While Jenkins and GitHub Actions are popular CI solutions, there are several alternatives, for example:

- **GitLab CI/CD**: Integrated into GitLab, it offers seamless version control and CI/CD integration. It can be used both as a cloud service and self-hosted.
- **Azure Pipelines**: A CI/CD service from Microsoft Azure that supports various languages and platforms, offering robust integration with other Azure services.
- **Drone**: A container-native, self-hosted CI/CD platform built on Docker, which provides a scalable and flexible CI/CD environment.

## Cloud-Based vs. Self-Hosted

Our setup is best suited for a cloud-based environment, specifically GitHub Actions. Given our small team size, the advantages of a self-hosted environment, such as customized infrastructure and potentially lower costs at scale, are minimal. GitHub Actions offers seamless integration with our existing GitHub repositories, simplifying the setup and maintenance of our CI pipelines. Additionally, the cloud-based nature of GitHub Actions provides scalability, reliability, and a managed infrastructure, allowing our team to focus more on development rather than maintenance.
